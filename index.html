<!-- DOCUMENTATION
Hi I am Ayush Nigam and for my final project I made a website for my personal portfolio. The purpose of choosing this option is that as it gives access to my resume and every little detail about my work, experience.
  I did not include canvas and sprite image besause when I tried implementing sprite image it was not looking professional and i didnt find any utility of canvas in my portfolio.
  I made a clock on about page with the help of javascript and I used CSS transition in thankyou.html page.
